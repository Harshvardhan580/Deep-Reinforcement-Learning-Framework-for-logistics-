# **Develop Solutions to Optimize Logistics in Food DeliverY** 

# Problem Statement 
+ Design and implement an algorithm to optimize food delivery rider assignments and routes in the city of Lucknow.

+ The goal is to develop an efficient system that minimizes rider idle time,optimizes travel distances, ensures on-time deliveries, and effectively manages multiple pickups and drop-offs while adhering to rider capacity constraints.

# Objectives:
Breaking down the Logistics involved : 
+ Determine service boundaries 
+ Group nearby orders 
+ Order Allocation 
+ Get shortest routes 
+ Optimize multi delivery routes 
+ Step-by-step Navigation 
+ Avoid Highways and Tolls 
+ Get real time ETA 

# Approach 1: 
This approach uses Google's OR-Tools Constraint Solver to solve a Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD). The system models the courier decision process as a combinatorial optimization problem. The solution considers pickup and drop locations, vehicle capacity, and distance constraints, using the Haversine formula to compute distances between locations. The OR-Tools library applies heuristic and metaheuristic search strategies to find an optimized route. 

+ The main components of this approach are:
  - Data Model Creation: Defines locations, orders, and vehicle constraints.
  - Distance Matrix Computation: Uses the Haversine formula for realistic distances.
  - Routing Solver Configuration: Implements pickup-and-delivery constraints and vehicle capacity limits.
  - Solution Evaluation: Computes and prints the route, total distance, and total payload.

+ Pros:
  - Efficient Optimization: Uses OR-Tools' heuristics (e.g., Parallel Cheapest Insertion, Guided Local Search) to find near-optimal solutions quickly.
  - Flexible Constraints: Easily adjusts vehicle capacity and order weight constraints.
  - Scalable: Can handle multiple vehicles, larger order sets, and dynamic constraints.
  - Realistic Distance Calculation: Haversine formula ensures accurate travel distances.
  - Automated Pickup & Delivery Matching: Ensures correct order fulfillment.
+ Cons:
  - Single-Vehicle Limitation: Currently supports only one vehicle; 
  - scaling to multiple vehicles needs further implementation.
  - Computational Overhead: Larger datasets may require higher processing power and longer solution times.
  - Static Distance Matrix: Ignores real-time traffic or road conditions.
  - No Route Re-Optimization: Cannot adapt dynamically to on-the-go changes like real-world delays.

+ Conclusion: 
  - This approach is well-suited for structured delivery scenarios with predictable routes and limited vehicle availability.

# Approach 2
This approach utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize meal delivery by efficiently assigning orders to couriers. It employs a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and Hard Updates (DDQN+H) to train an agent that learns to minimize delivery times while maximizing rewards.
+ Pros:
  - Dynamic Order Assignment:
Unlike rule-based systems, RL dynamically adapts to real-time changes in demand, courier availability, and traffic conditions.
  - Optimized Delivery Efficiency:
By minimizing delivery times and intelligently assigning couriers, the approach improves overall operational efficiency.
  - Scalability & Generalization:
The trained model can be applied to multiple couriers and different regions, making it scalable.
  - Adaptive Learning:
The model continuously improves based on past experiences, adjusting strategies to maximize total rewards.
  - Automated Decision-Making:
Reduces reliance on human dispatchers by automating courier assignments through learned policies.

+ Cons:
  - Computationally Expensive:
Training deep RL models requires significant computational power, especially for real-world, large-scale implementations.
  - Complexity in Implementation:
Setting up an RL environment, defining the right reward function, and fine-tuning hyperparameters can be challenging.
  - Cold Start Problem:
Initially, the model may perform poorly due to the lack of experience, requiring extensive training before deployment.
  - Risk of Suboptimal Policies:
If not trained with diverse scenarios, the model might overfit to specific conditions and fail to generalize well.
  - Difficult to Interpret Decisions:
RL models, particularly deep Q-networks, function as black boxes, making it hard to interpret why a specific action was taken.


# Approach 3
+ Overview: DRL4Route is a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework designed specifically for Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction (PDRP). The framework leverages deep learning models to capture workers' behavior patterns and integrates reinforcement learning to optimize non-differentiable objectives, enhancing route prediction accuracy. 

+ Proposed Model: The model, DRL4Route-GAE, employs an actor-critic architecture with a Generalized Advantage Estimator (GAE) to balance bias and variance in policy gradient estimates. This approach significantly contributes to improving route prediction accuracy.
Pros and Cons of the Approach
+ Pros:
  - Alignment of Training and Test Objectives:
By leveraging reinforcement learning, DRL4Route directly optimizes non-differentiable test criteria (e.g., LSD, KRC), addressing the common mismatch between training and evaluation metrics.
  - Improved Performance:
The framework significantly outperforms existing methods, showing substantial improvements in metrics such as LSD and ACC@3 on real-world datasets.

  - Flexibility:
DRL4Route can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component with existing deep learning models, enhancing their predictive performance.
  - Online Deployment:
The model has been successfully deployed in a real-world logistics platform, demonstrating its practical applicability and effectiveness in dynamic environments.
+ Cons:
  - Complexity:
The use of an actor-critic architecture combined with GAE introduces additional complexity compared to traditional supervised learning models.
  - Training Overhead:
Joint training of actor and critic networks requires more computational resources and extended training time.
  - Hyperparameter Sensitivity:
The model's performance is sensitive to hyperparameters such as Î» (lambda) in GAE, necessitating careful and precise tuning for optimal results.

# Conclusion: 
+ The Approaches mentioned(2,3) are formulated and need to be altered and built upon so that we can develop a solution on production level. 
+ The above approaches were taken into consideration because they have been proved to be giving most efficient and optimal results.
+ Integrating the above approaches with a clear domain knowledge would help to bring out more useful insights. 
+ Rather than creating one single integrated pipeline , it would be better to have API endpoints to meet various objectives at each step.
